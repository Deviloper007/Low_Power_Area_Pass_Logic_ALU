The input signals are shown below

As we can see that the signal levels are more vulnerable to noise than the conventional full adder because in such logic NMOS will also be used to drive high logic and PMOS to drive the low logic.

The average power consumed by this 10t ALU is 1.117 uW 

The power consumed by 6T FA particularly is 0.913 uW

The 28T FA is shown below

It is observed that the signals have a high noise margin ratio as it is based on strict cmos logic

The average power this 28T FA consumes is 8.971 uW

We can clearly observe that 6T adder saves power by 89.82% power
